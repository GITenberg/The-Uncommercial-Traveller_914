description: "The Uncommercial Traveller is a collection of literary sketches and\
  \ reminiscences written by Charles Dickens.\nIn 1859 Dickens founded a new journal\
  \ called All the Year Round and the Uncommercial Traveller articles would be among\
  \ his main contributions. He seems to have chosen the title and persona of the Uncommercial\
  \ Traveller as a result of a speech he gave on 22 December 1859 to the Commercial\
  \ Travellers' School London in his role as honorary chairman and treasurer. The\
  \ persona sits well with a writer who liked to travel, not only as a tourist, but\
  \ also to research and report what he found; visiting Europe, America and giving\
  \ book readings throughout Britain. He does not seem content to rest late in his\
  \ career when he had attained wealth and comfort and continued travelling locally,\
  \ walking the streets of London in the mould of the fl√¢neur, a 'gentleman stroller\
  \ of city streets'. He often suffered from insomnia and his night-time wanderings\
  \ gave him an insight into some of the hidden aspects of Victorian London, details\
  \ of which he also incorporated into his novels.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
